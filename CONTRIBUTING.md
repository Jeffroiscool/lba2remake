Any kind of contribution is very much welcome.

Check the [milestones](https://github.com/agrande/lba2remake/milestones) if you want to know what needs to be done.

We're trying to keep the code well organized, readable and maintainable, although we're not enforcing any rule for that at the moment, so do what you can and send your pull requests, we'll discuss things as needed.
